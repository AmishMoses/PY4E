# Service Oriented Approach
'''
Most non-trivial web applications use services
They use services from other applications
    credit card charve 
    hotel reservation systems
Services publish the 'rules' applications must follow to make use of the service (API)

Multiple Systems
Initially - two systems cooperate and split the problem
As the data/service becomes useful - multiple applications want to use the infomation/application
