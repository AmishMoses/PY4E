'''
Relational DBs model data by storing rows and columns in tables. 
The power of the relational DB lies in its ability to efficiently retreieve data from those tables 
and in particular where there are multiple tables and the relationships between those tables involved in the query


Terminology
Database - Contains many tables
Relation (or table) - contains tuples and attributes
Tuple (or row) - a set of fields that generally represents an 'object' like a person or a music track
Attribute (also column or field) - one of the possibly many elements of data corresponding to the object represented by the row


A relation is defined as a set of tuples that have the same attributes.
A tuple usually represents an object and information about that object. 
Objects are typically physical objects or concepts.
A relation is usually described as a table, which is organized into rows and columns.
All of the data referenced by an attribute are in the same domain and conform to the same constraints

SQL 
Structured Query Language is the language we use to issue commands to the DB
Create a table, Retrieve some data, Update data, Delete data CRUD
