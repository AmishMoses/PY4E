# Object Oriented Definitions and Terminology 
'''
This lecture is a lot more about 'how it works' and less about 'how to use it'

Methods are functions built into objects

# Object Oriented 
A program is made up of many cooperating pbjects
Instead of being the 'whole program' - each object is a little 'island' within the the program and cooperatively
working with other objects
A program is made up of one or more objects working together - objects make use of each others capabilities

# Object
An object is a bit of self-contained code and data
A key aspect of the OOP approach is to breaj the problem into smaller understandable parts
Objects have boundaries that allow us to ignore un-needed detail
We have been using objects all alongL strings, intergers, dictionaries, lists... all objects

# Definitions
Class - a template
Method or Message - A defined capability of a class
Field or Attribute - A bit of data in a class
Object or Instance - A particular instance of a class
